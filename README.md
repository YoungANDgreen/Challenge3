# Challenge3

Intent: The intent of this project was to practice my abilities to manipulate javascript functoins and leverage logic to help generate a random password generator that would be able to both ask for user input as well as confirm that the user has input values to enable the generator to meet criteria set by the user after answering prompts.

Motivation: To build the fundamentals of javascript functions, callback functions, logical statements, conditional statements, and practice Math functions.
